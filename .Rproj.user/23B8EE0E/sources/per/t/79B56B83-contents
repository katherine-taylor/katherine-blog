In 2018, I took one of my first classes that utilized the R programming language. For that class, I had to analyze a dataset of my choice, and perform one (!!) statistical test. I decided that in 2021, I wanted to go back and see what else I could do on the same dataset, given that I had a lot more knowledge of R and statistics. 

The said dataset was the scores from the 2018 Olympics in ice skating (BuzzFeed News). Buzzfeed had done an analysis of how judges from the same country as the skaters usually gave inflated scores. In 2018, I had wanted to perform that analysis, but it was above my level of knowledge. Now in 2021, I could actually replicate the analysis, and practice my model building skills.
