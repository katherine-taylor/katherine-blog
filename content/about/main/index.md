intro: I'm currently a senior business analyst at Capital One, where I solve customer problems using a mix of analytics and strategy. I'm very passionate about advancing inclusion in the workplace, and a strong advocate of mental health. I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2020 with degrees in Systems Engineering and Statistics, where I also served as drum major of the marching band for two years. In my spare time, I love to play bassoon, read, and play lots of board games.
