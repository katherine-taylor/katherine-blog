intro: "I'm currently getting my master's degree in mathematics education, with the goal of teaching in a secondary school following graduation. I got my undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 2020 in Systems Engineering and Statistics, where I also served as drum major of the marching band for two years. In my spare time, I love to play bassoon, read, and watch Formula One.

Teaching Philosophy: I believe that math should be taught in an engaging, accessible way that is interesting to students. Math does not to be taught via a teaching centered lecture, and can be the foundation of a project learning based curricula. All students are capable of finding success in a mathematics classroom. "
