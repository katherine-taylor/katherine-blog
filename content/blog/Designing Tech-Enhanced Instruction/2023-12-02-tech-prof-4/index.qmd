**Technology:** Virtual field trip 

**Link to Proficiency:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iMpVlvF4ao>

**Targeted Learners/Content area:** Middle school math (8th grade)

**Lesson objectives:** Learn more about how math, statistics, and data
visualization is used in the US Census

**Lesson context:** This virtual field trip would be used for students
to learn more about careers at the census bureau, and how math is used
in the Census. This lesson would likely take place across both math and
civics courses, and integrate with the civics content on the Census. 8th
grade math requires students to produce and analyze scatter plots, and
the virtual field trip could provide a strong tie into data the students
could analyze. 

**Goal of technology use:** The goal of technology use is to provide
students a window into what census workers data, and different careers.
Given the video is only around 16 minutes, this could easily fit into a
class period, when visiting the Census bureau could be an entire day
field trip. The video also provides more accessibility given that it has
closed captions, in a way that an actual field trip may not. 

**Brief description of how technology will be used with students:**
Students would likely watch the video in a classroom, and then would get
to experiment with some of the tools for analyzing and visualizing data
showcased in the video. Students could build interactive scatter plots
as well as other visualizations based on the video. There is also an
interactive quiz at the end of the field trip that students could
participate with.
