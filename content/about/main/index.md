intro: I'm currently taking a break from working to get my master's degree in mathematics education, with the goal of teaching in a secondary school following graduation. I got my undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 2020 in Systems Engineering and Statistics, where I also served as drum major of the marching band for two years. In my spare time, I love to play bassoon, read, and watch Formula One.
