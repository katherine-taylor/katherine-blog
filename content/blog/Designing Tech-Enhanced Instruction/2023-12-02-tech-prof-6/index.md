**Technology:** Badges 

**Link to Proficiency:** [Transformations
Badges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nVFhCbki2Hc7Kx9WqlfPyAf9zTOu9pG60z7pJxbt5lo/edit?usp=sharing)

**Targeted Learners/Content area:** Middle school math (8th grade)

**Lesson objectives:** The student will: given a polygon, apply
transformations, to include translations, reflections, and dilations, in
the coordinate plane (Virginia SOL standard 8.7)

**Lesson context:** Students would complete each of these activities
listed under the badges following a whole class mini lesson. Some
activities are labeled as challenge activities that students could
choose to engage with as an extension. 

**Goal of technology use:** The goal of the technology use is to enable
students to complete activities at their own pace, and get badges as a
reward for completing each component of the unit. The badges would be
used to motivate students to complete the assignments.

**Brief description of how technology will be used with students:**
Students will have access to the badge sheet through their LMS. Students
would be expected to work independently, and flag me down if they have
any questions. When students complete a category, they would receive a
sticker from me that they could place on their laptop, or other surface
of their choosing.
